   The 'Music CD Identifier' frame is intended for music that comes from a CD, so that the CD
   can be identified in databases such as the CDDB [CDDB]. The frame
   consists of a binary dump of the Table Of Contents, TOC, from the CD,
   which is a header of 4 bytes and then 8 bytes/track on the CD plus 8
   bytes for the 'lead out' making a maximum of 804 bytes. The offset to
   the beginning of every track on the CD should be described with a
   four bytes absolute CD-frame address per track, and not with absolute
   time. This frame requires a present and valid "TRCK" frame, even if
   the CD's only got one track. There may only be one "MCDI" frame in
   each tag.
