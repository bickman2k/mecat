   This is the 'Involved people list' frame.
   Since there might be a lot of people contributing to an audio file in
   various ways, such as musicians and technicians, the 'Text
   information frames' are often insufficient to list everyone involved
   in a project. The 'Involved people list' is a frame containing the
   names of those involved, and how they were involved. The body simply
   contains a terminated string with the involvement directly followed by
   a terminated string with the involvee followed by a new involvement
   and so on. There may only be one "IPL" frame in each tag.
