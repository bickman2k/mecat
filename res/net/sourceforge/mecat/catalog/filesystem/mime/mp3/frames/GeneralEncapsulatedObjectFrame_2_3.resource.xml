   In the 'General encapsulated object' frame any type of file can be encapsulated. After the header,
   'Frame size' and 'Encoding' follows 'MIME type' [MIME] and 'Filename'
   for the encapsulated object, both represented as terminated strings
   encoded with ISO 8859-1 [ISO-8859-1]. The filename is case sensitive.
   Then follows a content description as terminated string, encoded as
   'Encoding'. The last thing in the frame is the actual object. The
   first two strings may be omitted, leaving only their terminations.
   MIME type is always an ISO-8859-1 text string. There may be more than
   one "GEO" frame in each tag, but only one with the same content
   descriptor.
