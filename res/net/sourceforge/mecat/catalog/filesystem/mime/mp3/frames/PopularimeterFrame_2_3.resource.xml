   The purpose of the 'Popularimeter' frame is to specify how good an audio file is.
   Many interesting applications could be found to this frame such as a
   playlist that features better audio files more often than others or
   it could be used to profile a person's taste and find other 'good'
   files by comparing people's profiles. The frame contains the email
   address to the user, one rating byte and a four byte play counter,
   intended to be increased with one for every time the file is played.
   The email is a terminated string. The rating is 1-255 where 1 is
   worst and 255 is best. 0 is unknown. If no personal counter is wanted
   it may be omitted. When the counter reaches all one's, one byte is
   inserted in front of the counter thus making the counter eight bits
   bigger in the same away as the play counter ("PCNT"). There may be
   more than one "POPM" frame in each tag, but only one with the same
   email address.
