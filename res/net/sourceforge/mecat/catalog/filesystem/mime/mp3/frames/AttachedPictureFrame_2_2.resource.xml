   The 'Attached picture' frame contains a picture directly related to the audio file.
   Image format is preferably "PNG" [PNG] or "JPG" [JFIF]. Description
   is a short description of the picture, represented as a terminated
   textstring. The description has a maximum length of 64 characters,
   but may be empty. There may be several pictures attached to one file,
   each in their individual "PIC" frame, but only one with the same
   content descriptor. There may only be one picture with the picture
   type declared as picture type $01 and $02 respectively. There is a
   possibility to put only a link to the image file by using the 'image
   format' "-->" and having a complete URL [URL] instead of picture data.
   The use of linked files should however be used restrictively since
   there is the risk of separation of files.
