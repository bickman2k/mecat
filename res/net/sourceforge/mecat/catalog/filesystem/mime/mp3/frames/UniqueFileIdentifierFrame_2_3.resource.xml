   The 'Unique file identifier' frame's purpose is to be able to identify the audio file in a
   database that may contain more information relevant to the content.
   Since standardisation of such a database is beyond this document, all
   frames begin with a null-terminated string with a URL [URL]
   containing an email address, or a link to a location where an email
   address can be found, that belongs to the organisation responsible
   for this specific database implementation. Questions regarding the
   database should be sent to the indicated email address. The URL
   should not be used for the actual database queries. The string
   "http://www.id3.org/dummy/ufid.html" should be used for tests.
   Software that isn't told otherwise may safely remove such frames. The
   'Owner identifier' must be non-empty (more than just a termination).
   The 'Owner identifier' is then followed by the actual identifier,
   which may be up to 64 bytes. There may be more than one "UFID" frame
   in a tag, but only one with the same 'Owner identifier'.
